## What I Build ⚙️

I build software that connects the **low-level world of systems programming** with the **human-facing side of the web**. In practice, this means:

- Writing shells, servers, and network protocols in **C and C++98**  
- Designing event-driven architectures with **poll()**, non-blocking sockets, and signals  
- Shipping secure, containerized web apps with **Docker, Nginx, Node.js, TypeScript, SQLite, Tailwind CSS**  
- Prioritizing clarity, structure, and code that’s easy to understand tomorrow as well as today
